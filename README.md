# build_nn-from-scratch
Implementing shallow &amp; deep neural net from scratch
1. Single Neuron:
	- Replicated logistic regression ML model using Single Neuron 
	- Z=W.X+b 
	- sigmoid(Z)
	- Implemented back propagation to update W, b

2. Shallow Network with 1 Hidden Layer:
	-  Hidden Layer with tanh activation.
	-  Output layer with sigmoid activation.
	-  There is no Limit on the no.of neurons in the Hidden Layer.

3. Deep Neural Network with user defined L-layers and activations. 
	- L hidden layers
	- user can inpute L & activations required.
	- There is no limit on the No.of Layers
	- there is no limit on the neurons in the Hidden layer
